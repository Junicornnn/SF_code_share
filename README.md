# SF_code_share
This is the repo for the Manchester Star Formation group to share useful scripts for analysis and other quality of life features.
Note that you are posting and downloading at your own risk. No one is actively maintaining this repo so if something does not work from the start you will need to sort it out yourself.
When submitting scrips please try to follow the rules below:
- Have a clear and explicit file name
- Have a paragraph describing what the code is doing, the context where it should be used, what data format it expects and any important relevant information
- Clean up the code and remove any unnecesary parts
- Have precise doc strings and comments throught the code
- If possible, try to submit a notebook showing the output of the script but only have the script in **ONE** cell
- Update the code here if you end up having to change the code you uploaded
